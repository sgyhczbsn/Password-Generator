## RAD Implementation
1. **Requirements Planning**: Define the basic functionalities and features of the password generator.
2. **User Design / Prototyping**: Develop a working prototype (password_generator.py) quickly.
3. **Iterative Development**: Refine the prototype through multiple iterations of testing (password2(final).py).
